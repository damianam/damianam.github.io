            Know your gear series: Harness, fitting to your body and effects to consider. Part 3.
        </h1>

        <p>
        During the first and second part of these articles, we've gone over harness construction and options. This is
        very important knowledge to order a new harness/container. If you do, and the measurements for it are done
        properly, you shouldn't worry too much about fitting of the harness. Chances are that the manufacturer will do
        a good job and your brand new harness will fit you perfectly. However, this third part will help you to verify
        that. More importantly, if you buy a second hand harness, this article will help you to find out if the harness
        you are buying is appropriate for you.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Body types and hip rings
        </h2>

        <p>
        The above paragraph holds true for most people. A harness made to measurment will fit perfectly the vast
        majority of times. But in some cases, you should observe more carefully the harness contruction of your
        manufacturer of choice, even if you order new. Certain designs might adapt better to your body than others. That
        depends on the placement of the hip rings and the length of the container.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Torsos and container lenght
        </h3>

        <p>
        Long torsos, when mixed with short containers, present one problem. Think about the point where the lateral
        go from the container to the MLW. If the hip ring location is right in the lateral junction, the articulation
        will be too high. The leg straps will hinge in an unnatural point, above the hip, which could make the harness
        less comfortable than harnesses with the hip ring lower on the MLW. That's why it could be a good idea to get a
        harness with the hip rings connected below the laterals, if you have a long torso and a short container.
        </p>

        <p>
        People with short torsos should consider the opposite than people with long torsos, particularly if they have a
        long container. That can be common for new skydivers that are on the shorter end. In this case, the lateral will
        be already laying fairly low on the body. That's why having hip rings that connect the leg straps, laterals and
        MLW, could be a good idea. Otherwise the geometry of the leg straps might not fit properly the body of the
        wearer.
        </p>

        <p>
        To accomodate both end of the spectrum, and wearer preferences, some manufacturers might offer both types of
        articulations. Mirage, for instance, offers both types in their G4s.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Effects of bad harness fitting by sections and positions
        </h2>

        <p>
        A poorly fitting harness could be not just less comfortable, but also compromise your performance and even your
        safety. The following subsections will dig deeper in this.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Yoke and shoulders
        </h3>

        <p>
        The yoke size depends basically on how wide your chest and shoulders are. A smaller yoke than you need would be
        uncomfortable and limit the movements in your uppper body. If the MLW around the shoulders is too short and
        narrow that would also effectively move everything up &mdash;handles, 3 rings, chest strap and hip rings&mdash;.
        However, a bigger yoke and shoulder area than you need could create other issues in head down attitudes. A large
        yoke and long MLW result in a harness too loose at the shoulders. What this means is that when flying head down
        or steep angles your rig might slide down one shoulder. While this is rarely a safety concern &mdash;the yoke
        would have to be really side and the MLW really long to allow your rig to slide down both shoulders&mdash; it is
        unsettling and uncomfortable while flying. This could distract you and affect your performance.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width=1024 id="responsive-image" src="images/headdown.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                Wide yokes and head down attitudes are bad combinations. This harness is a bit too big for the wearer,
                and even a belly band to keep the container closer to the body can't fix it in all the attitudes.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
        The sliding becomes more noticeable in certain harnesses with chest rings, since this extra articulation makes
        the harness more flexible and more prone to this situation. Over-tightening the chest strap can help to
        compensate a bit this situation, but just to a certain degree. Likewise, if you tend to have your chest strap
        on the loose side, this could happen more easily.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img width=1024 id="responsive-image" src="images/tracing.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                Even with a harness that fits, loose chest straps can also result in harnesses that move too much.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>
            MLW
        </h3>

        <p>
        The length of the MLW should match the length of your torso. If the MLW is too short, you won't be able to
        properly tighten your legs straps. That would be uncomfortable, since the front of the leg straps, the part
        close to the buckle, might be in contact with your inner thigh, without any padding. Besides that, the alignment
        of the hip rings would be off and the fit would be generally speaking bad and the feeling would be of a rig that
        limits your movements and is too tight.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the opposite could be arguably worse. A MLW that is too long for your torso will allow too much
        wiggling of your rig. On sit fly the container will move upwards to your head. On head down it will move
        downwards as we saw above. On belly flying it will wiggle freely and push you around.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img width=1024 id="responsive-image" src="images/headup1.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                A MLW that is too long lets your container move too much on headup.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        Worse than that, your handles will move with your container. That means that instead of being in a fixed
        position, they will have an area where they might be. When you run out of altitude and you really need to grab
        your handles, you need to know where they are, as close as possible as the position where they are when you
        practice your emergency procedures in the ground and on the airplane. There is a natural shift when under
        canopy, but this displacement should be as small as possible, which is guaranteed with a proper fit.
        </p>
        <p>
        The shift when under canopy is because your weight rests now in the leg straps, with the MLW connecting that
        weight to the canopy above your head. As a result, your handles move upwards, but they aren't the only thing
        moving. The chest strap moves upwards as well. In some extreme cases you can even get hit in the throat or face
        by it, which is obviously something you should avoid and a very clear indicator of a MLW too long for you.
        Moreover, if you are a woman and on the busty side, you should also make sure that the chest strap rests on your
        chest and not below, as other wise the chest strap might hurt you during opening.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Laterals
        </h3>

        <p>
        Laterals are once again one of the parts that are more ignored when testing a second hand harness, but still are
        a very important part to guarantee a good fit. If they are too short you'll feel like the rig is too tight. But
        if they are too long your container won't be snug enough.
        </p>
        <p>
        Laterals too long have a similar effect than a MLW too long, when it comes to keeping the container close to
        your back. They will allow your rig to lift off your back. When on your belly that means that the rig will move
        around, and you will have to reach farther for your hand deploy. When sitflying, the wind will catch your rig
        and fill the space between your back and your rig, making your maneuvers less efficient and your position more
        difficult to keep under control. Backtracking in a straight line will also be more difficult with your rig
        moving laterally and pushing you off course.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img width=1024 id="responsive-image" src="images/headup2.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                In this case the MLW is just a tiny bit too long, but if the laterals where shorter the fit would be
                much better.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>
            How do I know if a rig fits me?
        </h3>
        <p>
        A rig made to your measurements should fit snug and tight, but it shouldn't restraint your movements. If you
        buy a second hand harness, you could check if it fits your properly checking these points. <b>After tightening
        the straps</b>, your harness should fit like this:
        <ul>
            <li>
                You should feel slightly constrained when standing up, feeling the tension of the harness on your
                shoulders all the way down to your legs. If you don't feel that tension, the MLW might be too long.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cutaway and reserve handles should be immediately below your chest and to the sides. If they are
                down to your belly is a sign that the MLW is again too long.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the ground you should be able to move your container off your back just a little bit. If you can fit
                more than one fist between the rig and your lower back (below the lumbar curve) your laterals or MLW
                might be too long.
            </li>
            <li>
                You shouldn't be able to tighten your chest strap so much that the MLW gets too inward distorted. Rigs
                with chest rings have more yield in this area.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you can pull one side of your rig below your shoulder while the other side stays in position, the
                yoke might be too wide for you.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you stand up the junction where the front and back sides of the leg strap join should be slightly
                below your hip bone, at the point where your leg articulates. Depending on the type of hip ring and leg
                strap construction your rig has, the ring would sit there, or slightly higher.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should be able to comfortably tighten your leg straps. The padding should cover the webbing at all
                points. At the same time, the straps shouldn't be loose around your legs when fully tightened.
            </li>
        </ul>
        It is important to note that these points focus on an optimal and comfortable fit. If your rig doesn't fit you
        as described, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is unsafe for you.

                        they are at the same height than the beginning of the butt curve. The leg straps have a

        <h3>
            Harness resizing
        </h3>
        <p>
        So you found a nice used container, you paid for it, get it ready to be jumped, and you found out that the
        harness doesn't fit you. It is uncomfortable, moves around too much, or doesn't really hold you as you think it
        should. What to do? You can pass it along another jumper whose body is a better fit for that harness, or you can
        get the harness resized. The price and feasibility of these alterations depend a lot on the parts to be altered
        and the number of rings on the harness. These are some things to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rigs with rings make resizing and replacing some parts of the harness much easier. Leg straps can be
                more easily replaced with hip rings than without them. If the rig has chest rings, adjusting the lower
                MLW is also easier than without them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shortening the chest strap is the cheapest alteration you can do. Lengthening it is also a fairly cheap
                and easy procedure. You can even buy an extension that connects to your original chest strap.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shortening the leg straps is a fairly easy task. Making them longer implies replacing or tweaking the
                whole assembly, including padding. If the leg strap is a single piece, this could be more complicated
                than in two pieces setups.
            </li>
            <li>
                MLW adjustments are tricky &mdash;ie: expensive&mdash;, specially without chest rings, or with rigs
                where the laterals are sewn directly to the MLW.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adjusting the laterals implies adjusting the MLW in some cases, and the back padding and container. It
                is possible but it could be a fair bit of work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, modifying the yoke is rarely done, and chances are that you are better off looking for another
                rig.

            Harness sizing per manufacturer
        </h3>

        <p>
        So, someone over internet wants to sell you a rig, and they say that the size is 17+1. Or C17. Or 16.5, 17 +.5.
        Or something else. Sadly, there isn't a standard way to report harness sizes. Each manufacturer has their own
        way. However, most manufacturers state the length of the MLW in the data card of their rigs. UPT for instance
        writes down the length of the MLW followed by the deviation of their standard yoke size (in positive or negative
        numbers). Sunpath states the size of the yoke with a letter, which goes from smaller to bigger (A, B, C, D...)
        followed by the length of the MLW. Mirage is more precise, and states the MLW, followed by the length of the leg
        straps, and the deviation from their standard lateral length. Mirage also has a very <a href="https://miragesys.com/support/harness-sizing-calculator/">
        handy tool to find out the harness size using your measurements</a>.
        <p>
        </p>
        Bottom line is that everyone does it differently. You'll have to check case by case. Manufacturers have the
        measurements of every rig they make, so you can ask them using the serial number of the rig you are interested
        on.

        <p>
        As you can see, there is more to harness fitting than &ldquo;tight&rdquo; or &ldquo;loose&rdquo;. When buying a
        second hand harness you need to consider all the dimensions of the harness and your body to guarantee a proper
        fit.
